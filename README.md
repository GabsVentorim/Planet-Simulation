# Planet-Simulation

  This is a planet simulation using Python! The goal of this is to simulate the orbits of different planets around the sun using real astronomical values. Was also applied the force of gravity on each of the planets so we get an accurate elliptical orbit from Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.
