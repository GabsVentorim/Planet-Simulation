# Planet-Simulation

  This is a planet simulation using Python! The goal of this is to simulate the orbits of different planets around the sun using real astronomical values. I also applied the force of gravity on each of the planets so I get an accurate elliptical orbit from Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.
